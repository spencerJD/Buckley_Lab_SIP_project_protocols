This code assumes you have a dataset named "DATA" which includes the variables "ROW" (A-H), "COLUMN" (1-12), and "INTENSITY" for each sample.

Here's the code:

```
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(DATA, aes(y = factor(ROW, rev(levels(ROW))),x = factor(COLUMN))) + 
     geom_point(aes(colour = INTENSITY), size =9)  +  #change size of dots as appropriate
     theme_bw() + 
     labs(x=NULL, y = NULL) +   #change axis labels as appropriate
     scale_color_gradient(low="grey", high="purple")   #change color gradient scheme (unless you don't dig purple, which is incomprehensible)
     
```
