General Spore Counts from Soil
==============================

## Soil
* Remove all debris (sticks, rocks, etc.) from soil sample
* Per 10mL of medium, add 0.25g of soil/ 0.025g per 1mL
  * Store in 2mL microfuge tubes
  * Reduce mass if soil is not completely soluble

## Making Sporulation Medium
*Add appropriate volume of sporulation medium to soil
* Difco sporulation medium per liter: (doi: 10.1073/pnas.082121599 PNAS April 16, 2002 vol. 99 no. 8 5241-5246)
      * 8 g of Bacto-nutrient broth
      * 10 ml of 10% KCl 
      * 10 ml of 1.2% MgSO4Â·7H2O
      * 0.50 ml of 1 M NaOH
      * 1.0 ml of 1 M Ca(NO3)2
      * 1.0 ml of 0.010 M MnCl2
      * 1.0 ml of 1 mM FeSO4
        *Add agar as necessary (15g per liter)

## Spore Selection/Heating
* Heat at 80 degrees C for 10 minutes in water bath
    * Use fungicides at lower temperatures
    * Test for Streptomyces
    
## Plating and Dilutions
* Three serial dilutions- adding 100 microliters to each plate for a total dilution of:
  * (10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5) for aerobic
  * (10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5) for anaerobic
    * Reduce dilution factor if low colony counts
* Create 2 spread plates of each dilution on sporulation medium plates 

## Incubation
* Incubate one of each dilution spread plates in a microaerophilic conditions (anaerobic chamber)
  * Microaerophilic conditions closer to rhizosphere habitat
* Incubate the other corresponding dilution plate in aerobic conditions
* Keep both plates at temperatures around 30-35 degrees C for 24 hours
  * Longer incubation times may lead to loss of countable colonies

## Plate Counts
* Determine spore CFU/mL of each plate
* Calculate spore CFU/mass of soil
