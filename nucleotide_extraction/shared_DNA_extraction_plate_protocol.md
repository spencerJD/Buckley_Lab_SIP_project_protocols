Shared DNA Extraction Plates
============================

* If you have less than 96 samples for DNA extraction, samples can be loaded onto a shared
plate.
* Shared plates will go through DNA extraction once they are filled.
* Each plate will have a labeled name and corresponding spreadsheet on a shared Google Doc.

## Printing this protocol

See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)


## Plate Naming
* Plates will be named with the date the first samples are added in the following format:
  * Numerically – Day, Month, Year (eg. January 4, 2016 would be 04012016)
* Plates will be labelled on both ends in Sharpie marker, or with a label.

## Google Doc Management
* Each plate will have one corresponding sheet in the Shared Plate Google Doc file.
* If you are the first person to add samples to a shared plate, it is your responsibility 
to create the sheet on the DNA Extraction Shared Plates Google Doc.
* Each sheet will have the following layout:
  * Plate name
  * Contact information for plate users
  * Plate diagram
  * Plate metadata
* Users are responsible for adding their own sample names/numbers to the appropriate cell
in the Google Doc worksheet.
* Plate diagram will be updated post DNA extraction to inform users that their DNA is
ready.
* If you are the person to run the plate DNA extraction, it is your responsibility to
inform all other plate users that their DNA is ready. 
* Cell color coding will be used as follows:
  * White: Well is available to add sample.
  * Green: Well is occupied by sample and ready for extraction.
  * Blue: DNA has been extracted; samples in the labelled plate in the -20C freezer.
  * Orange: DNA has been removed from plate by user. If the entire plate is Orange, plate
  can be discarded.
* It is the responsibility of the user who runs the plate DNA extraction to change color
from green to blue.
* If the entire plate is Orange, plate can be discarded.
* If cells in the plate are Blue, continue to store plate in -20C freezer.
* It is each user’s responsibility to update the plate Google Doc with these appropriate
colors as quickly as possible.
