===============================

## Printing this protocol

See **Printing protocols** in the [README](../README.md#printing-protocols-conversion-of-protocols-to-pdf)

## Leaf Litter Samples
This protocol will guide you through the methods for preparing leaf litter samples for DNA extraction from freshly collected litter.

Litter samples are located in the -80 C freezer in room 625 in Bradfield Hall. Sample Bags will have the sample name and time written on one side.

## Materials Needed

* Leaf Litter Bag
* Coffee Grinder
* 70% Ethanol
* Alcanox Soap
* 2 mL centrifuge tubes
* Spatula
* Paper Towels
* Sharpie pen
* Latex gloves

## Method

* Before starting, clean all instruments (coffee grinder, spatula) with 70% ethanol.
* Remove leaf litter bag from the top shelf of the -80 C freezer.
* With your hands, crush large leaves inside plastc baggie with your hands. (Do not open the baggie, keep it closed and crush the leaves.)
* Write the sample name on the lid and side of a 2 mL centrifuge tube in Sharpie.
* Add leaf litter to the coffee grinder until the blade is covered (you may use your hands to help, but be sure to wipe your gloves with ethanol between samples)
* Put the lid on the coffee grinder, plug it in, and hold down the grind button for 15 seconds. Sometimes shaking the grinder while it is in operation can help to move the sample around.
* Unplug the grinder, remove the lid, and carefully scoop the ground leaf litter particles into the 2 mL centrifuge tube. Tamp down the litter particles until the tube is full.
* Dump/scoop the remaining ground leaf litter back into the original leaf litter bag. 
    * If there is a large amount of remaining litter stuck to the grinder interior, use a gloved hand to wipe it out into the trash.
* Wash the grinder with water and alcanox, careful not to get much water into the vents on the bottom of the grinder. Wash both the interior chamber and the lid.
* Rinse the interior chamber and the lid with ethanol, and wipe with a paper towel.
* Place the litter bag back into the -80 freezer on the shelf second from the top, and get a new bag from the top shelf. 
* Repeat.

At the end of the day, place all tubes with leaf litter in them in a centrifuge tube box and into the freezer.
